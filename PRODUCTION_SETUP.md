# Production Setup Guide for AI API Broker

## ‚úÖ What I've Fixed For You

I've implemented all the code-level fixes:

1. ‚úÖ Created billing webhook handlers (`apps/gateway/src/routes/webhooks.ts`)
   - Stripe webhook for credit purchases
   - PayPal webhook (basic implementation)
   - Admin endpoint for manual credit addition
2. ‚úÖ Mounted webhooks in the main app (`apps/gateway/src/index.ts`)
3. ‚úÖ Updated API documentation with proper curl examples (`apps/site/app/api-docs/page.tsx`)

## üîê What You Need To Do: Set Secrets

Secrets cannot be committed to code for security. You need to set them using Wrangler CLI.

### Required Secrets (Must Set Before Deployment)

```bash
cd apps/gateway

# Provider API Keys
npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
# When prompted, paste your OpenAI API key

npx wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# When prompted, paste your Anthropic API key

npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_API_KEY
# When prompted, paste your Google API key (for Gemini)

# Upstash Redis (for metering/credits)
npx wrangler secret put UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL
# Example: https://your-db.upstash.io

npx wrangler secret put UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN
# Your Upstash Redis REST token
```

### Optional Secrets (For Additional Features)

```bash
# ElevenLabs (for TTS)
npx wrangler secret put ELEVENLABS_API_KEY

# Stability AI (for music generation)
npx wrangler secret put STABILITY_API_KEY

# RapidAPI Integration (if selling on RapidAPI)
npx wrangler secret put RAPIDAPI_SECRET

# Stripe (for billing webhooks)
npx wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
npx wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

# Admin endpoint (for manual credit addition)
npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_SECRET
# Set this to a secure random string
```

### How to Get These Keys

1. **OpenAI API Key**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Anthropic API Key**: https://console.anthropic.com/
3. **Google API Key**: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
4. **Upstash Redis**: https://console.upstash.com/
   - Create a Redis database
   - Copy REST URL and token from the database details page
5. **ElevenLabs**: https://elevenlabs.io/
6. **Stability AI**: https://platform.stability.ai/
7. **Stripe**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Set All Required Secrets (see above)

### 2. Initialize Test API Keys in Redis

Before deployment, you need to give test API keys some credits. Use the admin endpoint or directly set in Redis:

**Option A: Using Upstash Console**
- Go to your Upstash Redis console
- Add key: `user:test-key-123:credits` with value: `10000`

**Option B: After deployment, use admin endpoint**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-worker.workers.dev/admin/add-credits" \
  -H "X-Admin-Secret: YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"apiKey":"test-key-123","credits":10000}'
```

### 3. Build the Gateway

```bash
cd apps/gateway
npm run build
```

### 4. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

```bash
npm run deploy
```

You should see output like:
```
Published ai-api-broker-gateway (X.XX sec)
  https://ai-api-broker-gateway.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
```

### 5. Test Your Deployment

```bash
# Replace YOUR_WORKER_URL with your actual worker URL
export WORKER_URL="https://ai-api-broker-gateway.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev"
export TEST_KEY="test-key-123"

# Test balance
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_KEY" "$WORKER_URL/v1/balance"

# Test chat (OpenAI)
curl -X POST "$WORKER_URL/v1/chat" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hi"}]}'

# Check balance again (should be reduced)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_KEY" "$WORKER_URL/v1/balance"
```

### 6. Configure Stripe Webhook (Optional)

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-worker.workers.dev/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select event: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy the webhook signing secret and set it:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   ```

### 7. Update Docs Site

```bash
cd apps/site
# Set the worker URL in your environment
export NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL="https://ai-api-broker-gateway.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev"
npm run build
npm run deploy  # Or your preferred deployment method
```

## üìä Monitoring & Logs

View real-time logs:
```bash
cd apps/gateway
npx wrangler tail
```

Or view in Cloudflare Dashboard:
- Go to Workers & Pages
- Click on `ai-api-broker-gateway`
- Click "Logs" tab

## üß™ Testing Credit Purchases (Stripe)

Test the Stripe webhook:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-worker.workers.dev/webhooks/stripe" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "stripe-signature: test-sig" \
  -d '{
    "type": "checkout.session.completed",
    "data": {
      "object": {
        "metadata": {
          "apiKey": "test-key-123",
          "credits": "5000"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

Check that credits were added:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test-key-123" \
  "https://your-worker.workers.dev/v1/balance"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

1. **Stripe Webhook Signature Verification**: The current implementation has a TODO for proper signature verification. For production, implement proper verification using the `stripe-signature` header.

2. **Admin Endpoint**: The `/admin/add-credits` endpoint should only be used for testing. In production, either:
   - Remove it entirely
   - Implement strong authentication
   - Restrict via Cloudflare Access or similar

3. **API Key Management**: 
   - Generate secure random API keys for users
   - Store them in Redis with initial credit balance
   - Consider implementing key rotation

## üìã Production Checklist

- [ ] All required secrets set via `wrangler secret put`
- [ ] Test API keys initialized in Redis with credits
- [ ] Worker deployed and accessible
- [ ] Balance endpoint returns correct credits
- [ ] Chat endpoint works with all 3 providers
- [ ] Credits are deducted after requests
- [ ] Insufficient credits returns proper error
- [ ] Stripe webhook endpoint configured (if using billing)
- [ ] Docs site deployed with correct NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL
- [ ] Monitoring/logging enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting considered (future enhancement)

## üéØ Expected Credit Costs

Based on current pricing configuration (`MARGIN_MULTIPLIER=1.8`, `STRIPE_PRICE_USD_PER_CREDIT=0.01`):

| Endpoint | Estimated Cost | Credits Deducted |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Chat (gpt-4o-mini) | ~$0.002 | ~1 credit |
| Image (DALL-E 3) | ~$0.04 | ~7 credits |
| TTS (10 seconds) | ~$0.003 | ~1 credit |
| Music (1 clip) | ~$0.05 | ~9 credits |

Actual costs may vary based on:
- Token count for chat
- Number of images requested
- Audio duration
- Model selection

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Missing API key" Error
- Check that you're sending Authorization header
- Verify the API key exists in Redis with credits

### "INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS" Error
- Check balance: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer KEY" URL/v1/balance`
- Add credits via admin endpoint or Upstash console

### Provider Errors (502)
- Verify provider API keys are set correctly
- Check provider API key has sufficient quota
- View logs: `npx wrangler tail`

### Webhook Not Working
- Verify webhook secret is set
- Check Stripe webhook signing secret matches
- View logs to see webhook payloads

## üìö Next Steps

1. **Implement Proper Signature Verification**: For Stripe webhooks
2. **Add Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse
3. **Build User Dashboard**: For users to manage API keys and view usage
4. **Implement Subscription Plans**: Recurring credit top-ups
5. **Add Usage Analytics**: Track costs vs revenue

## üÜò Getting Help

If you run into issues:
1. Check logs: `npx wrangler tail`
2. Verify all secrets are set: `npx wrangler secret list`
3. Test locally first: `npm run dev` (uses local environment)
4. Check Cloudflare Workers dashboard for error details
